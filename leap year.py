An extra day is added to the calendar almost every four years as February 29, and the day is called a leap day. It corrects the calendar for the fact that our planet takes approximately 365.25 days to orbit the sun. A leap year contains a leap day.

In the Gregorian calendar, three conditions are used to identify leap years:

The year can be evenly divided by 4, is a leap year, unless:
The year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless:
The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.
Given a year, determine whether it is a leap year. If it is a leap year, return the Boolean True, otherwise return False.

def is_leap(year):
    leap = False
    
    # Write your logic here
    if year%400==0 :
        leap = True
    elif year%4 == 0 and year%100 != 0:
        leap = True
    return leap

year = int(input())
print(is_leap(year))
